## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: Added docstrings and fixed arguments. 

Summary of function(s) added: The function added is called drawStar and is implemented in the playDarts function. This function calls for a star (with a different color for each side) to be drawn if a player wins the dart game. If there is a tie, no star is drawn. 

Summary of Feature Added: The first feature added is a second smaller circle within the original circle. When a dart lands inside this smaller circle, the turtle shape is changed to a circle and the color purple and it leaves a stamp where the dart hit. Along with this, a message stating "So close to the bullseye!" is printed for the user to see. The second feature added was the drawStar function which draws a star.
